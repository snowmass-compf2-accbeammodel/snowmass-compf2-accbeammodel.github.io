Code of Conduct
===============

Please see the `Snowmass 2021 code of conduct <https://snowmass21.org/>`_.
As an APS-sponsored process, we will abide by the `APS code of conduct <https://www.aps.org/meetings/policies/code-conduct.cfm>`_ for all meetings.

This interest grou[ is also part of the process, so in our conversations here we pledge to conduct ourselves in a professional manner that is welcoming to all participants and free from any form of discrimination, harassment, or retaliation.
Participants will treat each other with respect and consideration.

In addition, APS DPF has drafted a set of Core Principles and Community Guidelines to which members pledge to adhere.
Please see the `Snowmass page <https://snowmass21.org/>`_ for more information.
