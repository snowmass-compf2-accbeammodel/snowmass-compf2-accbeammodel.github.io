==========

`Snowmass 2021 Letters of Interest (LOI) <https://snowmass21.org/loi>`_ are informal documents intended to be useful in the first stages of the Snowmass study.
They will help Snowmass conveners to prepare the Snowmass Community Planning Meeting that will take place early November 2020 virtually.
LOIs could include opinions, interests and proposals that could further be studied.
They should contain a maximum of 2 pages of text, plus relevant bibliography.
Please make these as simple and easy to read as possible.
Authors of the letters are welcome to make a full writeup for their work as a contributed paper and submit it to the Snowmass proceedings.
However, a contributed paper is not required.

**LOIs should be contributed until August 31, 2020**.

For our interest group, we propose to use a simple template to simplify the process:

Proposed Template
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We suggest to use the following template for LOIs:

* Topic and status.
* Current and future challenges.
* Advances needed to meet challenges.

We maintain lists of :ref:`proposed <loi-proposed>` and :ref:`submitted <loi-submitted>` LOIs. 

.. note::

   We rely on the community (you) to inform us about proposed and submitted LOIs by sending emails to AccBeamModelSnowmass21@lbl.gov.
