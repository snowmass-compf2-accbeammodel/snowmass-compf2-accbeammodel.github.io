As the *Accelerator & beam physics modeling* interest group in the `Theoretical Calculations and Simulation (CompF2) <https://snowmass21.org/computational/simulations>`_ topical group in the `Computational Frontier <https://snowmass21.org/computational/start>`_ our topics of interest include:

* **Modeling of**

  * Specific types of accelerators (leptons, hadrons, gamma, mix)

    * Injectors
    * High power targets
    * Linacs
    * Rings (multi-bunch injection, etc.)
    * Recirculating systems
    * Energy recovery systems
    * Fixed field accelerators (FFAGs, etc.)
    * Colliders

  * Advanced Concepts

    * plasma accelerators (LWFA, PWFA)
    * dielectric
    * muon accelerators
    * integrable optics accelerators

  * Specific physics/operational topics

    * space charge
    * beam-beam
    * halo formation
    * emittance preservation
    * wake fields
    * impedance
    * electron cloud
    * collisions
    * radiation production and transport
    * spin dynamics
    * coherent synchrotron radiation
    * quantum limit in novel accelerator structures
    * X-ray simulation
    * extreme beams
    * power deposition and resulting radioactivation
    * cooling
    * beam-material interactions (ionization, atomic processes,...)
    * dynamic processes during operational scenarios (machine generally has to go through intermediate states with changing optics and fill patterns before it reaches its steady state)
    * injection painting
    * slow extraction
    * slip-stacking
    * ...

  * Components and realistic beamline elements (fringe fields, high-order effects, etc.)

    * RF cavities
    * Magnets
    * structured plasmas
    * ...
    
  * ...
* **Crosscutting topics**

  * Commonalities in comp. needs
  * EVA (End-to-end Virtual Accelerator)
  * Design optimization
  * HPC / Exascale / programming

    * GPUs; future hardware
    * higher order methods/numerical linear algebra to make efficient use of GPUs
    * computing hardware independent implementation e.g. Kokkos/RAJA/Alpaka/AMReX
    * Mixed precision: half (various), single and double
    * Tensor cores
  * Standardization of output data, input scripts (openPMD, ...)
  * Data management & data reduction
  * Online modeling
  * AI/ML
  * Open Science
  * Resources, training
  * Cloud computing
